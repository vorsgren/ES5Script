## Scripts for installing GOG version of game on Linux

Installs Game from the GOG files, along with various modding tools, etc

# TODO/Coming Features:

Check that wine, winetricks, wine dependencies, and Vulkan Drivers are installed.

Implement Basic unmodded install from GOG files/WineGE (install.sh)

Make install.sh install Mo2.

Make install.sh install LOOT, link to Mo2

Make install.sh install SSEdit/XEdit, link to Mo2

Make install.sh install Wrye Bash, link to Mo2

Make install.sh set up QuickAutoClean link in Mo2

Make install.sh optionally install necessary mods that are harder to install (SKSE, Engine Fixes, etc)

Make install.sh set up Eslify link in Mo2

Make install.sh set up reference handle cap script in XEdit, see if link in Mo2

Make mo2.sh launch Mo2

Make sky.sh launch SKSE

Make install.sh install Dyndolod/Texgen, Link to Mo2

Make an optional feature where install.sh optionally installs all mods in a folder. (make it report if something went wrong with some, etc.)

See if you can make Mo2 setup so it stops complaining about not being connected to Nexusmods site.

Make a script that checks if esync is enabled - and warn if it is not.
